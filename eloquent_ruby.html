# Back to basics
.center[
![powerwashing](http://i.giphy.com/dWpA1cYlyyb1C.gif)
]

???
This whole presentation isn't to neccesarily teach you anything new, but to just start a conversation, and
get everyones brains a little bit back to basics.

We can get lost in the trudge of day in and day
out programming, getting Pull Requests in, getting alerts squashed.

So Take this as an opportunity to just
sit back, and think about some of the finer points of the language we use everyday.
---

# !TODO
  - Fundamentals
  - Blocks
  - Methods
  - Classes
???
  - A few basics (some thigns you know but might have taken for granted)


  This book is full of great material. The rest will be just highlighting some parts of
  the ruby language that I found particularly interesting.

  A little higher level than just
  making you guys listen to all the ways strings can be manipulated.

- Blocks, methods, and then classes

---
class: middle, inverse
> "Ruby is a language for grownups. It gives you the tools for writing clear and concise code, but it's up to you to use them."

???
This is quote that really stood out to me in the book.

At least for me, it's something I think I take for granted more often
than not.

Ruby really gives us all the control when writing code.

Just the thought of having to define the Type our function will
take in and the type it will return makes most of us squeem. let alone strongly typed variables as well.

---
name: dynamic
## Dynamic Typing
???
As we all know, Ruby uses dynamic typing, meaning we don't have to explicitly state types.

Arguemnt types, variable types, return value types.

There are some clear advantages to this.
---
template: dynamic
name: dynamic2
- Compact code
???
Our code is very compact.
---
template: dynamic
#### Java
```java
public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```
---
template: dynamic
#### Ruby
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello World!"
end
```
---
template: dynamic2
name: dynamic3
- Flexibility
???
Any two classes that CAN work together WILL work together

---
template: dynamic3
name: dynamic4
  - Any two classes that **can** work together **will** work together
---
template: dynamic4
- Duck Typing
???
Dynamic typing causes us to use something i'll talk about in a minute called Duck Typing.
---
name: clean_code
## Why Write Clean Code?
???
As we all know, ruby uses dynamic typing.
---
template: clean_code
name: clean_code_2
- Clear and Concise == Fewer Mistakes
???
Some motivation to write clean code

- Clear and Concise == Fewer Mistakes

- Ruby lacks "Documentation" of strong typed languages
  Strong typed languages have words surrounding methods and variables that give the user insight into what's happening.
---
template: clean_code_2
name: clean_code3
- Ruby lacks "Documentation" of strong typed languages
---
template: clean_code3
name: clean_code4

```java
public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World!");
	}
}
```
???
Back to our java example,

one advantage to this is that it gives the user a much

clearer picture on wahts happening here.

I mean who wouldn't love to write things like this??
---
template: clean_code4
name: clean_code5
```ruby
def is_longer_than?( number_of_characters )
  @content.length > number_of_characters
end
```
???
Ahhhh much better.

Here we use variable and argument names to help the user understand what's going on with our code.
---
template: clean_code5

#### Same functionality
```ruby
def long(num)
  @content.length > num
end
```
???
As we all know, naming is important.

This function is pretty easy to figure out if you have the whole picture. but


If i'm in a controller that's using my `long` function,

I'm probably going to ahve to look it up to see whats going on.
---
class: inverse, middle
"The look of the code matters. It matters because the people who use the code, read the code, and maintain the code matter."
???
Some motivation to write clean code
I really like this quote as well. It's cheesy, but if you're going to work in this industry where things change constantly and new technologies, companies
and jobs come and go, the people involved in creating this stuff are the constant that matters.

---
name: object_title
## Everything's an object
---
name: objects
template: object_title
 - `-3`
???
 Next I'm going to talk about some key elements to Ruby.

 I'm not goingto go into detail about all of these, but more go over some

 of the points that I found interesting.
---
name: shouting
class: center, middle, shout
#OBJECT!

---
name: objects2
template: objects
 - `"hello"`
---
template: shouting
---
template: objects2
 - `false`
---
template: shouting
---
template: object_title
name: duck
#####Duck Typing
 - Rely less on the type (or class) of an object and more on what methods can be called on it and what operations can be performed on it
---
template: duck
 - `respond_to?`
 ```ruby
   "hello".respond_to?(:to_sym)
 ```

???
Duck typing
 - Strong typing and the fact that everything is an object means Ruby has

 a tendency to be less concerned on the type of the Object and more on what methods can be called and what operations

 can be performed on it.

---
name: blocks
## Blocks
---
template: blocks
```ruby
@people.each do |person|
  puts "Your name is #{person.first_name}"
end
```

???
I think everyone here is well aware of what blocks are how important they are in ruby.
---
template: blocks
name: execute
##### Execute around

???
Execute around is the executing code before or after a block.
---
template: execute
```ruby
  class SomeApplication

    def do_something
      with_logging('load') { @doc = Document.load( 'resume.txt' ) }

      #Do something with the document...

      with_logging('save') { @doc.save }
    end

    def with_logging(description)
      begin
        @logger.debug( "Starting #{description}" )
        yield
        @logger.debug( "Completed #description}" )
      rescue
        @logger.error( "#{description} failed!" )
      end
    end
  end
```
???
This is the finished product of the example he gives.

If you want to see the progression he took to get to this point,

I definitely recommend reading it in the book. It's only about 3 pages.

The with_logging method is doing something before

and after the block is executed.
---
template: blocks
name: initialize
##### Initialize with Execute Around
---
template: initialize
name: initialize2
```ruby
def initialize(title, author, content = '')
  @title = title
  @author = author
  @content = content
  yield(self) if block_given
end
```
---
template: initialize2
##### This allows you to:
```ruby
  new_doc = Document.new('US Constitution', 'Madison', '') do |d|
    d.content << 'We the people'
    d.content << 'In order to form a more perfect union'
    d.content << 'provide for the common defense'
  end
```

???
You can allow your init function to accept a block, and use that block to initialize your objects.
---
template: blocks
name: keep
#### Things to keep in mind:
- Blocks take scope with them
- Pass arguments that the **execute around** method needs, not what the block needs
- Explicitly return values
???

- Blocks take scope with them, so anything available before the `|` or `{` is available in the block.

- The examples I've shown you, just throw away the value produced by the block. If you want to return a value
you need to explicityl return it.
---
template: keep
```ruby
    def with_logging(description)
      begin
        @logger.debug( "Starting #{description}" )
        return_value = yield
        @logger.debug( "Completed #description}" )
        return_value
      rescue
        @logger.error( "#{description} failed!" )
      end
    end
```
???
This will take the value that the block returns, and then return it.
---
name: methods
## Methods
---
template: methods
name: methods2
####Operators are methods
---
template: methods2
name: methods3
```ruby
foo = first + second
```
---
template: methods3
name: methods4
Is the same as
```ruby
foo = first.+(second)
```

???
Once you realize this, you can overwrite these operators to meet your needs.
---
template: methods
name: math
.center[.middle[
![math](http://www.thetrc.org/wp4/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/math_operators_538x265.png)
]]
???
be care to remember the "cloud" of ideas that operators conjure for anyone using them.

---
template: methods

.center[
###`c = a + b`
]

???
no one expects the value of B to change in this expression.

**Authors Note**: Ruby's `equal?` is so good, theres no reason to change it. Ever.

---
name: singleton
## Singleton Methods
---
template: singleton
name: singleton2
##### Methods defined for one object instance
```ruby
    hand_built_stub_printer = Object.new
    def hand_built_stub_printer.available?
      true
    end
```
---
template: singleton2
name: singleton3

**Class methods** are singleton methods

???
All methods inherit from Class, and we make a method on something like `Document`,

we don't want it on all Class objects.

---
template: singleton3

]

---
name: missing
## Method Missing
???
we can overrie `method_missing` in any of our classes and handle missing method cases ourselves.
---
template: missing
name: missing2
#### Error Handling

```ruby
class RepeatBackToMe
  def method_missing( method_name, *args)
    puts "Hey, you just called the #{method_name} method"
    puts "With these arguments: #{args.join(' ')}"
    puts "But there ain't no such method"
  end
end
```
???

---
template: missing
name: missing3

#### Magic Methods

```ruby
Class FormLetter < Document
  def replace_word( old_word, new_word )
    @content.gsub( old_word, '#{new_word}' )
  end

  def method_missing( name, *args )
    string_name = name.to_s
    return super unless string_name =~ /^replace_\w+/
    old_word = extract_old_word(string_name)
    replace_word( old_word, args.first )
  end

  def extract_old_word( name )
    name_parts = name.split('_')
    name_parts[1].upcase
  end
end
```
???
Lets pretend we have a docment class,

and now we have templates to generate letters to our

customers. We have to start writing methods to replace strings in the template like FIRST NAME.

We can `def` a new method for each and every type of string we might be replacing, or use method missing.

`FIRST_NAME`, `LAST NAME`

---
template: missing3

```ruby
# Calling this
replace_gender( 'Dude' )

#Would result in this
replace_word( 'GENDER', 'Dude')

```
???
Method missing is also very helpful in Delegation, creating internal DSL's and creating friendlier API's

##Classes

Breaking up your code into many short single

purpose methods not only plays to the strengths of Ruby,

but also makes your application more testable.
---
template: classes
name: classes2

#### Composed Method Technique
Each method should:
???
Divide classes into methods with three characteristics

---
template: classes2
name: classes3
- Do a single thing
???
Easier to write and understand
---
template: classes3
name: classes4
- Operate at a single conceptual leve
???
don't mix high level logic with nitty gritty details
---
template: classes4
name: classes5
- Have a name that reflects it's purpose
???
**The computer doesn't care about the names of your methods,

variabels, etc. Following this principle helps you, the human, get the details right**

  # Most of class omitted...
  def prose_rating
    if pretentious_density > 0.3
      if informal_density < 0.2
        return :really_pretentious
      else
        return :somewhat_pretentious
      end

    # Somehow compute density of pretentious words
  end

  def informal_density
    # Somehow compute density of informal words
  end
end
```
---

  def prose_rating
    return :really_pretentious if really_pretentious?
    return :somewhat_pretentious if somewhat_pretentious?
    return :really_informal if really_informal?
    return :somewhat_informal if  somewhat_informal?
    return :about_right
  end

  def really_pretentious?
    pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density < 0.2
  end

  def somewhat_pretentious?
    pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density >= 0.2
  end

  def really_informal?
    pretentious_density < 0.1 && informal_density > 0.3
  end

  def somewhat_informal?
    pretentious_density < 0.1 &&  informal_density <= 0.3
  end

  def pretentious_density
    # Somehow compute density of pretentious words
  end

  def informal_density
    # Somehow compute density of informal words
  end
end
```

Breaking these things out really helps clarify your code,

makes it easier to understand and of course

Have to tow the line between adding value and adding clutter.

clearly the second picture is better than the first. But imagine if instead of

grouping these utensils 3 or four in a section, you decided to make an individual compartment for each one.

It would be terrible trying

to remember where each one is located, where each one goes back,

how it fits exactly in the compartment for htem all to fit.

---

template: classes
#### Open Classes
- You can change the behavior of **any** class at **any** time.
???
Organizing your code like we just talked about, really helps you leverage ruby's open classes.
change thebehavior of any class at any time.

---
template: messy_class
???
let's go back to our two class examples

Again, this one has just a few methods,

and one with a big if statement in it.

What if you had a class that inherits from this one,

but you just needed to tweek it.

With this class, most likely your only option is to copy,

paste, and rework it for your new subclass.
---
template: clean_class
???
Now with this class, you can easiy just re `def`

one of these classes to meet your needs.
---
template: classes
```ruby
class Lyrics < Document
  def really_pretentious?
    #changed the density
    pretentious_density > 0.7 && informal_density < 0.1
  end
end
```
???
this is a very small example of what monkey patching is.

???
Last def wins,

let's us define class methods for any class the current class inherits from,

and that method will be called first.

Active Support is a good example.

You could take this a step further,

put programming logic in your classes and define methods based on constants.

#### Modifying Open Classes
```ruby
if ENCRYPTION_ENABLED
  def encrypt( string )
    string.tr( 'a-zA-Z', 'm-za-1M-ZA-L')
  end
else
  def encrypt( string )
    string
  end
end
```
???
You can even create classes that modify their subclasses as well.
